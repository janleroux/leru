## Introduction
I grew up on a farm, and I was raised that you eat what you shoot. And if you are not going to eat it, then don’t shoot it (unless it is a pest, or something wanting to eat you first).

Feral goats are found throughout New Zealand in both the North and South Islands, and they are a pest everywhere. You see, the problem is that in little New Zealand, the only native animals are birds, some lizards and a couple of unique bugs (like Weta’s). So all other animals were introduce by man over time, and these animals have no natural enemies to keep their population within reasonable numbers.

This means that hunters like myself, play a big role in controlling the numbers of these animals. If we do not step up and do our bit, they will destroy our native fauna and flora, and that will force the government’s hand to try and eradicate them with poison like 1080 ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1080_usage_in_New_Zealand). Anyhow, not really the topic on my mind today.

Hunting these feral goats does not only mean I do my bit for conservation in New Zealand, but it also gives me access to some of the best grass-fed, free-range organic meat one can dream off. Who would say no to that?!

Billy goats emit quite a pungent smell, and most of the times you will smell them before you see them. And from my experience, the taste what they smell like. So the nanny’s are the preferred ones to hunt if you want to make a good goat curry.

So what do you need to make a good Goat Curry — glad you asked.

### Ingredients

- 1 kg Goat meat
- 2 Onions, chopped
- 1 Can of chopped Tomatoes
- Ginger, grated (Thumb size piece)
- 3 cloves of Garlic, grated
- 2 Jalapeño peppers, minced
- Pinch of ground Cardamom
- 1 Tablespoon butter
- 1 Bay leaf
- 1 Tablespoon Coriander powder
- Salt to taste
- 1 Teaspoon Turmeric powder
- 1 Teaspoon Garam Masala
- 2 Teaspoons Smoked Paprika
- 1 Teaspoon Cumin powder
- 0.5 Cup of water

### Method
This goat curry recipe is quite easy. 

Caramelize two chopped onions in a pan (if your slow-cooker can’t do it, or you are using a crock pot) and then add it to your pot.

Add all the rest of the ingredients

Slow cook it all on high for five hours — but stirr it regularly to make sure it does not catch at the bottom of the pot.

Serve with some Rice, Naan or Roti.
