This post describe the first steps in the making of a custom carbon fiber rifle stock, which covers the template or plug. This plug will be used to create a mold from. And from the mold, we can make the custom carbon fiber rifle stock.

In composite mold making, a plug (also called a pattern) is the master shape or template used to create the mold. It is an exact, full-scale model of the desired part or component. The plug is critical because the surface quality, dimensions, and geometry of the plug directly determine the quality of the final composite part.

## Key roles of a plug in composite mold making:
1. **Master Template**: The plug represents the exact dimensions and geometry of the final product.
1. **Surface Finish**: The surface quality of the plug (smooth, textured, etc.) will transfer to the mold, which in turn transfers to the final composite part.
1. **Mold Construction**: Once the plug is made, materials like fiberglass or carbon fiber are laid over it to create a negative impression (the mold).
1. **Prototyping**: The plug can be used as a prototype to test form and fit before the actual composite part is made.

A well-made plug is crucial for ensuring the accuracy and consistency of the mold and, by extension, the final composite components.

## Lets get on with it

### 1. Creating the paper design

Start by defining the basic two dimensional shape of the plug based on research, other similar items or experience from off-the-shelf items on which you identified areas you wish to improve on.

In my case, I based the design on Boyds At-One adjustable gun-stock and a GRS Bifrost. Both stocks I own, and both with features I like, but neither a perfect fit.

### 2. Transfer the paper design to the wood

I decided to use multiply to build my plug from because that allowed me to build up the stock in specific places where I want to have more material like for example the ergonomic grip area.

Transfer the paper design to the wood.

Because my plug is not symmetrical, I mixed some blue paint with the glue so that I can see where the approximate center line of the plug is (I will explain more about why this is helpful in the next blog post covering the mold making process)

The rest of the sheets of wood just get normal glue, but it is worth-while to spend your time to make sure the glue covers all areas of the sheets.

Combine all the glue covered multiply sheets, and use clamps to keep everything in place. Leave the glue to dry based on the glue manufacturer's specifications.

### 3. Rough-cut the wooden plug shape

### 4. Build the plug

### 5. Fit the Barreled-action
