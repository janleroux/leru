This is a test by JLR to see if this updates.

In composite mold making, a plug (also called a pattern) is the master shape or form used to create the mold. It is typically an exact, full-scale model of the desired part or component. The plug is critical because the surface quality, dimensions, and geometry of the plug directly determine the quality of the final composite part.

## Key roles of a plug in composite mold making:
1. **Master Template**: The plug represents the exact dimensions and geometry of the final product.
1. **Surface Finish**: The surface quality of the plug (smooth, textured, etc.) will transfer to the mold, which in turn transfers to the final composite part.
1. **Mold Construction**: Once the plug is made, materials like fiberglass or carbon fiber are laid over it to create a negative impression (the mold).
1. **Prototyping**: The plug can be used as a prototype to test form and fit before the actual composite part is made.

A well-made plug is crucial for ensuring the accuracy and consistency of the mold and, by extension, the final composite components

## Lets get on with it

### 1. Creating the paper design

### 2. Transfer the paper design to the wood
